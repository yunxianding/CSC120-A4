Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
Encapsulation is very useful because it allows us to decide which should be seen and modified and which should be hidden. But this also requires us to be very careful with where to use public and where to use private. I find it very necessary to my programming.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Overall, my code runs pretty well and seems to have met all the requirements. I feel like it's easiser when I know what attributes to have, how to set up the constructor and which methods to have by the professors' instructions. When I tried to added my own methods in Train.java, I met much difficulty because I wasn't sure how to connect the methods with the passengers and cars. It took a lot of trial and error to finally figure it out. My advice would be to list all the things you need to do as a checklist on a whiteboard and then write your code. I personally find it very helpful.
